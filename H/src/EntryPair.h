/*
* EntryPair is a class designed with the purpose of storing
* a string-string pair. One string will be the name of the entry, the other will be its contents.
* However, to avoid storing what may be a large string in a single std::string or wxString object,
* we will store its contents in an external text file and store the destination of the file in the second value of the pair.
